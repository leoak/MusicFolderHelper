# Step 1 - Checksum
As a user, I want to be able to verify that I have MD5 checksums files for all my music directories.

Given a Music folder containing folders for each artists, I want to know which directories contain an MD5 file.
The name of the MD5 file is the name of the directory:
`MusicFolder/Artist/Artis.md5`
